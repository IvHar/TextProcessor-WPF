# TextProcessor

**TextProcessor** is a basic WPF application made as education project for simple text manipulation. It allows you to:
- **Delete a word** from the text.
- **Reverse a word** and highlight it in red.
- **Find and highlight** all occurrences of a word in yellow, while showing how many times it appears.
- **Clean up spaces** by removing excess whitespace.
- **Encode/Decode** text by shifting ASCII characters by Â±2.

## Key Files
- **MainWindow.xaml**: Defines the user interface (RichTextBox, TextBoxes, and Buttons).
- **MainWindow.xaml.cs**: Contains the logic for text operations.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this project.
2. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio (or another WPF-compatible IDE).
3. Build and run the solution.
